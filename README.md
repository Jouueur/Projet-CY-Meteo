# Projet-CY-Meteo

Here is project developed to create grapihcs from meteo data where
you can ask for different graphics depending of what argument do you add after calling the program.

Download all the file and add:
          an empty directory named "bin"
          the csv file you want to work with.
          Note that you need to choose the sort method at the top of the mainc.c


DON'T FORGET TO CALL "chmod 755 main.sh" in your terminal before the fist time lauching the project.
To know how you can call the program, type in your terminal: ./main.sh --help or any command with --help in argument.
That will explain you all you need to know about the different possible arguments.
